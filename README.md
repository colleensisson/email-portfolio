# Email Portfolio

### About This Portfolio
This repository showcases a small selection of the many emails I’ve created for HiDow. These are some of my personal favorites, representing a range of standalone promotions and multi-email campaigns like Fall BOGO and Black Friday. Each email was crafted to align with HiDow’s sales goals while engaging the target audience through:

- **Strategic Planning**: Developing campaigns tailored to specific sales events.
- **Responsive Design**: Using **HTML/CSS** to create layouts optimized for all devices.
- **Visual Design**: Designing banners and graphics in **Canva** to maintain brand consistency.
- **Campaign Execution**: Managing and optimizing emails in **Klaviyo**, including analytics review and testing.
